	1. Autolab timeouts when we submit our code.
	2. Does not handle malicous peers perfectly.
		a. Sending illegal packets (no DENIED implementation).
		b. 
	3. Not checking hash of complete chunk. 
	4. Timeout values are not precise enough (milliseconds might be too little).
	5. Variable names don't use camel-case.
	6. Some leaked/lost memory.

To be frank, its only vulnerability is that it's invulnerable.
