At the end of each .c file, there is a main routine with small test cases. These
were our unit tests. For files such as ds.c that contained an in-house
implementation of a data structure, these unit tests tested core functionality.

For testing the peer executable as a whole, extra test cases similiar to that in the
handout were created. The provided Makefile contains test targets for these cases.
